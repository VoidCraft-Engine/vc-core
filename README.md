# VoidCraft-Core

VoidCraft is an experimental game engine, drawing design inspiration from Bevy.

As the core component, this project primarily includes the following modules:

- [`vc_utils`] : Platform-agnostic container extensions
    - Examples include hash functions and related containers, block linked lists, circular arrays, and stack-optimized dynamic arrays.

- [`vc_os`] : Cross-platform abstraction layer for host-side programs
    - Provides specific `std` implementations for `no_std` and `wasm` environments.
    - Examples include synchronization primitives like `Mutex` and `RwLock`, offering fallback implementations based on atomic variables and spin operations.
    - Multi-threading and file system abstractions are not yet implemented. The current workaround is to restrict `no_std` environments to single-threaded operation.

- [`vc_reflect`] : Dynamic reflection system
    - Implemented via compile-time AST modification, generating code through simple metadata annotations. Main features include:
    - 1. Runtime Type Information (RTTI), such as type names and IDs, generic information, and custom attributes (similar to attributes in C#).
    - 2. Type erasure, allowing different types to be stored as identical dynamic objects, supporting dynamic content manipulation.
    - 3. Global registry containing type information for all reflected objects, supporting interface (method) reflection and automatic type registration.
    - 4. Serialization and deserialization, enabling data serialization/deserialization based on reflection information without implementing `serde`.
    - 5. Path access, allowing multi-level field access via strings.

- [`vc_task`] : Task system (multi-threading and concurrency system)
    - Provides a task pool (thread pool) for managing thread resources.
    - Offers multiple async executors that work with the task pool to automatically handle asynchronous tasks and achieve multi-threaded load balancing.
    - Provides a parallel task interface that splits continuous tasks into chunks for parallel execution via the task pool.

- [`vc_ecs`] : Entity-Component-System
    - ECS for game engines, a data-oriented programming design pattern.
    - In progress.

VoidCraft introduces many modifications and optimizations compared to Bevy, such as:

- Merging `PartialReflect` and `Reflect` in the reflection system.
- Implementing a custom async executor in the task system instead of relying on `async_executor`.
- Providing more fallback implementations in the cross-platform module and offering additional utilities in the utility module.

The project also includes numerous structural adjustments, code refinements, and documentation improvements.
Some of these changes have been upstreamed to the `Bevy` engine, though larger-scale modifications could not be merged.
